 The present solution solves the problem posed in the following link: https://gist.github.com/nicopaez/511f730c68aff7ff651c39223e38763f.

 I used a class library (framework 4.6.2). In it we will find the bike class, which depending on the type gives us a price, and the offer class, which has a bike list and returns the total price to pay.

 To execute the tests. Go to test explorer and run all of them.
